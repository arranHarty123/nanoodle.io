          <h3>Open Representative Voting (ORV)</h3>
          <p>ORV is the Nano consensus mechanism that ensures transactions on the Nano network are legitimate;
            it protects the network against bad actors who may wish to conduct malicious actions such as conducting
            double
            spending attacks.</p>
          <p>Consensus is achieved through voting, and this is conducted by a Nano node. The Nano node software
            can be run by anybody wishing to help decentralise the network. See <a
              href="https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/Docker-node">here</a>
            for details on how to run a Nano node.</p>
          <p>Nano nodes hold a wallet with 1 or more accounts associated accounts, all of which can be nominated as a
            Representative by other accounts; nomination means that an account will delegate their own balance as voting
            weight to the Representative
            (account). This is
            a sensible approach where an individual is not running a node
            themselves (so they wouldn't be able to represent the voting power of the Nano in their own accounts).</p>
          <p>A
            Representative will vote on behalf of all the delegated Nano, in all the accounts that have nominated the
            Representative. Once a Representative gains 0.1% of the Nano supply in delegated weight, they are considered
            Principal Representative, and have their votes sent onward by the network (beyond the directly connected
            Nano nodes).</p>
          <p>Nominating a Representative is an important way to secure the health of the Nano network and ensure your
            Nano voting power is counted. It is an important feature for decentralisation of Nano voting power, and
            allow's individuals to change their Representative at any time for no cost. A Representative may be
            assessed on several factors including:
            <ul>
              <li>Online Availability</li>
              <li>Reputation</li>
              <li>Diversity</li>
              <li>Version</li>
              <li>Processing Power</li>
              <li>Voting Weight</li>
              <li>Synchronization</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In many cases, individuals will keep a default Representative on their account. This may be because they
              score highly
              on several fronts or will hold their Nano on an exchange where they may not get a choice of
              Representative. This can result in a more centralised Nano network. The long term aim is to have a wide
              selection of good Representatives, gaining voting weight from individuals so that Nano becomes more
              decentralised.</p>
